# summarize_Pathways2Targets2_output
This R script was made to summarize Pathways2Targets2.R (https://github.com/bpickett/Pathway2Targets) output, sorting drug hits by 
prioritizing drugs that hit the highest number of significantly modulated pathways. The only input required is the Pathways2Targets2.R 
output. You should edit the code to reflect the name of your incoming file and the name that you want your new file to be written under.
